# iOS-Style Calculator App

## Overview
This project is a **Calculator App** built using **ConstraintLayout** in Android. The design closely replicates the sleek and modern aesthetic of the iOS 16 Calculator, providing a polished user interface combined with essential calculation functionalities.

## Features
- **iOS-Inspired Design**:
  - Mimics the visual layout and styling of the iOS 16 calculator.
- **Responsive Layout**:
  - Built with ConstraintLayout to ensure the UI adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Core Functionalities**:
  - Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - Includes a clear button (AC) to reset the input.
  - Handles decimal operations accurately.

## How It Works
1. **User Interface**:
   - Buttons are arranged in a grid layout similar to iOS 16, with distinct colors for operators, numbers, and special keys (AC, decimal, equals).
2. **Functional Flow**:
   - Clicking on number buttons updates the input display.
   - Operator buttons trigger the respective operations.
   - The equals button computes and displays the result.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DBP625/ios-calculator.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the application on an emulator or physical device.

## Technical Details
- **ConstraintLayout**:
  - Used to achieve precise alignment and spacing between buttons.
  - Ensures the layout remains proportional across various screen dimensions.
- **Custom Styling**:
  - Applied custom XML attributes to replicate the iOS 16 button styles (rounded corners, gradients, and shadows).
- **Java/Kotlin Backend**:
  - Handles input parsing and computation logic.

## Contributions
We welcome improvements and new features! To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```
3. Commit your changes:

   ```
4. Push to the branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-name
   ```
5. Open a pull request.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for advanced operations (e.g., trigonometric functions, percentage calculation).
- Implement a dark mode for enhanced usability.
- Enable haptic feedback for button clicks.
- Optimize performance for larger screens like tablets.
